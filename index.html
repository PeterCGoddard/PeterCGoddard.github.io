   <h1>PETER'S PIZZA</h1> 
   <h2>It's All About the <strong>Pizza</strong></h2>
   <p>From the very beginning, Peter's Pizza was all about the healthy pizza
    options we could offer to the public.</p>
   <p>We started with just a simple, <em>gluten-free five-cheese pizza</em>,
    and now we have four different options for the selective pizza lover.
That means you can try a different pizza every day of the week and twice
on Sunday!</p>
